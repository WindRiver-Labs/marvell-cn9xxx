For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is not available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged standard/base..standard/<machine name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyAMA0 at 115200 baud. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression.  A value of
0x040080000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \
tftp $fdtaddr $fdtfile;booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
loadaddr=0x040080000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth1
ethact=eth1
bootfile=Image
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyAMA0
baudrate=115200

5. DPDK
=======

5.1 Build Configuration
-----------------------
Please refer to the "Build Configuration" section in the feature/dpdk/README
for more details about how to enable it.

5.2.1 Running the DPDK examples on CN96XX (non-sso)
---------------------------------------------------
The following uses the testpmd as an example to demonstrate how to run the DPDK
examples:
  1. Setup hugepages:
     # echo 24 >/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

  2. Bind the interfaces:
     # dpdk-devbind -u 0002:03:00.0 0002:05:00.0
     # dpdk-devbind -b vfio-pci 0002:03:00.0 0002:05:00.0

  3. Run the Application:
     # testpmd

5.2.2 Running the DPDK examples on CN96XX (sso)
-----------------------------------------------
The following uses the dpdk-test-eventdev as an example to demonstrate how to
run the DPDK examples:
  1. Setup hugepages:
     # echo 24 >/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

  2. Bind the interfaces:
     # dpdk-devbind -u 0002:0e:00.0 0002:05:00.0
     # dpdk-devbind -b vfio-pci 0002:0e:00.0 0002:05:00.0

  3. Create SSO VFs and bind to vfio-pci:
     # echo "177d a0f9" >/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id

  4. Clear limits of all devices created with “a0f9” device id as below:
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0a:00.0/limits/sso
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0a:00.0/limits/ssow
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0b:00.0/limits/sso
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0b:00.0/limits/ssow
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0c:00.0/limits/sso
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0c:00.0/limits/ssow
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0d:00.0/limits/sso
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0d:00.0/limits/ssow
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0e:00.0/limits/sso
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0e:00.0/limits/ssow

  5. Set limits as below:
     # echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0e:00.0/limits/tim
     # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0e:00.0/limits/npa
     # echo 16 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0e:00.0/limits/sso
     # echo 26 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0002:0e:00.0/limits/ssow

  6. Run the Application:
     # dpdk-test-eventdev -l 22-23 -w 0002:0e:0.0 -w 0002:05:0.0 -- --prod_type_ethdev --nb_pkts=0 --verbose 2 --test=pipeline_atq --stlist=A --w
lcores=23

6. WIC Image
============
Please refer to the Yocto manual for the detailed info about WIC. After building
the project, the WIC image is at:
   tmp-glibc/deploy/images/marvell-cn96xx/wrlinux-image-glibc-std-<machine name>.wic

Then user can burn this image to a SD card.

6.1 Burn the image to SD card
-----------------------------
    # dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-std-<machine name>.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev bs=1M conv=fsync

6.2 Set uboot env for cn96xx
----------------------------
    # setenv loadaddr 0x040080000
    # fatload mmc 0:2 $loadaddr Image
    # setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 maxcpus=24 rootwait coherent_pool=16M net.ifnames=0
    # booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr

    If you want to boot from the SD card, you also need to burn the boot
    firmware to the SD card with command like this after burning the WIC image:
        sudo dd if=octeontx-bootfs-uboot-t96.img of=/dev/your_sd_dev bs=512 seek=128 skip=128 conv=fsync

    Please ask the Marvell for the cn96xx boot firmware image.
